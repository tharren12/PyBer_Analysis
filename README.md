# Pyber Analysis

## Overview of Project

V. Isualize, the CEO of Pyber, has asked for a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type utilizing DataFrame in Pandas for Python. Additionally, she wants to see a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally a written submission that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at Pyber.

## Resources

* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

* Software: Python 3.6.8, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.0, Pandas Library 0.24.2

## Pyber Analysis Results

* Urban city type has by far the highest number of Total Rides, Total Drivers and Total Fares
* Urban city type is followed by Suburban then Rural in terms of total size
* The highest average fare per ride is in the Rural city type, followed by Suburban then Urban
* The highest average fare per driver is also in the Rural city type, followed by Suburban then Urban

* The total weekly fares for Urban city type were at the lowest at the beginning of Jan and towards the end of Apr, and had the highest points in late Feb and early Mar
* The total fares for Suburbaban city type were lowest at beginning of Jan and beginning of Apr and were at the peak at the end of Feb
* Total weekly fares were consistent for Rural city type but did have the highest points in late Feb and beginning of Apr


## Pyber Analysis Summary

The following summary are three potential action items that could be undertaken to address the most signifcant disparities between the city types.

1. Put more marketing dollars into Rural and Suburban cities in order to drive more rides, drivers and total fares.
2. Additionally, with more volume going into Rural and Suburban cities there will be increased profits due to higher average fares per ride and driver. Likely, the averages will come down slightly but can return a greater benefit per marketing dollar spent.
3. Incent Urban city drivers to drive in Rural and Suburban cities if possible as there are significantly more drivers in Urban cities and could help to boost demand in underserved cities.
